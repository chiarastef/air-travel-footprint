# Air Travel Footprint Calculator

This is the final project from the Front End Development Master offered by the online course provider [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/).

During the course I had the chance to learn HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Webpack and Vite.
I decided to complete the course by building a website from scratch using React: a site to calculate the carbon footprint of flights.
I chose this project because I believe that measuring our carbon footprint is the first step we can take to improve and adapt our lifestyle in order to reduce our emissions.
